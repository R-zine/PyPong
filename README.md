## About

Unfair Pong is a game where the player is pitted against a NEAT-trained AI. The objective is to convert the player's score into upgrades, which help defeat the otherwise unbeatable AI. The AI training was done with Pygame and Neat-python, while the live game is a React app which interacts with a Pyscript environment through DOM and Window objects. The retro styling is done with NES.CSS.
